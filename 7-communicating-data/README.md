# Communicating Data

Given that each of you are engaged in research, you are likely going to need to communicate data through data visualizations. These visualizations may consist of graphs, text, diagrams, and other components. You may combine these into posters, dashaboards or other types of user interfaces. Instead of trying to squeeze in UI design, we will just focus on data visualization this week, since it is a critical component of communicating data.

So, this week, I want you to take some time to think about how you can communicate data **your research + data** to different audiences through data visualizations. Even if you haven't started data collection, all of you have at least topical areas that you are interested in, so consider, at minimum, the types of data you might need to visualize in your work.

1. Watch this very short (~8min) video that introduces concepts of data visualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdSZJzb-aX8

2. Watch this in-depth webinar (~1hour) on "Introduction to Data Visualization"
   https://youtu.be/Bq-b2yc0Tig

3. Read this brief style guide + case study on data visualizations in the domain of climate change communication: https://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/resource-files/2021-04/apo-nid314650.pdf I share this as an example of how you might operationalize some of the things you learn about data visualization through the materials of this week. It looks longer than it is, pages 3-13 contain the core content, and it's very nicely laid out so don't anticipate densely packed text :)

4. A very short (~7 mins) video to give you an overview of web design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iVVM_DgWY4. Though we do not go into this topic, I thought this video did a neat job at explaining how different forms of web design fit together. This should suffice to close us out this week.

# Optional/Extra Resources

Paper on "The Science of Visual Data
Communication: What Works" https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/15291006211051956. This is a very in-depth article that looks at how and why different forms of communicating data work.

Another intro to data viz with an emphasis on spreadsheet based data viz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-opw-P4dYEg. Includes an intro to OpenRefine and Tableu.

Designing for Data 101: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLT69NDhLP8. Covers really concepts on infographics - if you're making a poster, this might be useful too!

Even. More. Resources. I've been enjoying the work I see come out of the Data Visualization Soceity, here's a link to their lists of resources: https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/resources. I found the books, challenges, and guidelines sections to be particularly helpful.

For some hands-on stuff, you can check out Module 2 from my Fall course: https://github.com/ag-informatics/ag-informatics-course/tree/main/module2

# SUBMISSION

Provide **1 page** overview of the different ways in which **you** will need to communicate data as part of your research. Here's the questions I want you to answer:

    1) What types of data or information do you need to communicate in your work? Are there particular types of insights that you are trying to glean or communicate through visualizations?

    2) Consider this data viz catalogue: https://datavizcatalogue.com/ Given the types of data that you are working with, which of these data visualizations do you think will be most productive in communicating your work? Give us a sense of how you might use different visualizations for different types of data from your work.

    3) What are your main challenges when it comes to visualizing and communicating your research and data?

    4) If you know, what tools might you use to build your data visualizations? What resources are you looking for?

    5) Questions: A list of 3-5 questions for the in-class discussion.

## Overview of the topic

Data visualization is not only an important way to communicate data to others, but also provide an insight for us to understand our own data. It is hard to find out the pattern of a large group of data by looking at it, but with the help of data visualization, we can get the insights within few seconds. Insights can lead to discover the visualizing patterns overtime (eg. time series data) and spotting difference,help to make decisions, analyze data, explain the spatial relationships, and tell a story of the data. Data visualization is a process that from obtaining data, parse and provide structure, filter the data of interests, mine the data patterns, represent with a visual model, to refine the visual presentation.

## Short Synopsis of Readings

_For each resource provided, create a <1 paragraph summary.]_

1. The Art of Data Visualization

    Three things you have to inform your design always: The first, you as a designer. What you have to say, and what you want to communicate? The second, the reader. They may not have any idea about your data, and may have their own bias or assumptions. The third one is the data. What it has to say and how that informs the truth? A successful infographic should be able to communicate a complicated data into a way that many people can understand.

2. Introduction to Data Visualization Webinar

    Data visualization is all about insight (and always remember to backup the original file). The insights can lead to an observation over time, a better understanding

## Summary of Key Takeaways from the Materials

_4-5 key takeaways, a few sentences to one paragraph each_

1. Data visualization is not only a pretty picture, but it's the purpose of visualizing insight.
2. Avoid yellow and distracting colors in background, and avoid for color blindness (eg. green and red).
3.

## Discussion Questions

_>4-5 questions_

1. What kind of tool or software you use for visualizing your data?
2. What kind of visualization you may need for your research data?
3. Which data visualization work is the most impressive that you have ever seen?
4.
